Hi 👋 My name is Jaden Kropp

I have always had a great interest in technology, I took many C.S courses growing up including a few years in college, I have worked as an Internet Safety Evaluator for over two years, and joined the 100Devs organization as a software engineer working with teams to create full-stack web applications. I am now looking to bring my skills to a tech company with global reach.
